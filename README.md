### General Information
In West Africa, elderly home care is uncommon, so we end up taking care of our elderly ones in our homes. Some of them are suffering from dementia and some of them are too weak to take care of themselves. On the other hand, most of us are busy with work or business or taking up one responsibility or the other. With so many things on our mind, we tend to forget about the elderly ones at home. Sometimes we forget what medication they are on, how many times they have taken their medication and sometimes we forget to monitor their blood pressure and sugar level. When we loose track of all these things we put our elderly ones in danger. We need to keep track of all these things for better treatment or well being of the elderly ones.
